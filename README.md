# react-currency-converter
## Read this!
#### I wanted to have more practice with useState and useEffect hooks, so I decided to make a currency converter.
#### I followed a tutorial on YouTube, but it was outdated which I realised only later when I wasn't able to do conversion between different currencies.
#### With free plan that I have, you can *only do conversion* with EUR to different currencies.
#### Nonetheless it was still a good practice, and I learned how to fetch api with ReactJs.
